\label{sub:Data preparation pipeline}
    Before the classfication, the data was prepared with several steps:
    \subsubsection*{Interpolation} 
        The different spectra were interpolated onto a common axis. Here the
        number of interpolation points wer
    \subsubsection*{Background Subtraction} 
        For each batch measurement a background measurement was recorded. Each
        spectrum was subtracted by the background measurement.
    \subsubsection*{Filtering} 
    \subsubsection*{Featuredesign}
