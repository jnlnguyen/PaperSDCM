	abstract = {We performed first experiments to evaluate the potential of photoluminescence spectroscopy to detect microplastics using a 405 nm laser diode for sample excitation. A set of nine bulk plastic samples and nine samples of natural materials typically found in the marine environment were examined and compared. The plastic and non-plastic materials could be differentiated based on the shape of the acquired photoluminescence spectra. Our results show that photoluminescence spectroscopy holds the potential for reliable characterization of environmental samples regarding the microplastic content.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is controlled by many simultaneous interactions, frequently measured collectively in biology and medicine by high-throughput technologies. It is a highly challenging task to infer from these data the generating effects and cooperating genes. Here, we present an unsupervised hypothesis-generating learning concept termed signal dissection by correlation maximization (SDCM) that dissects large high-dimensional datasets into signatures. Each signature captures a particular signal pattern that was consistently observed for multiple genes and samples, likely caused by the same underlying interaction. A key difference to other methods is our flexible nonlinear signal superposition model, combined with a precise regression technique. Analyzing gene expression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, our method discovers previously unidentified signatures that reveal significant differences in patient survival. These signatures are more predictive than those from various methods used for comparison and robustly validate across technological platforms. This implies highly specific extraction of clinically relevant gene interactions.},

	abstract = {Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) currently includes thousands of cultivars. Discrimination between these varieties, historically done by ampelography, is done in recent decades mostly by genetic analysis. However, when aiming to identify archaeobotanical remains, which are mostly charred with extremely low genomic preservation, the application of the genomic approach is rarely successful. As a result, variety-level identification of most grape remains is currently prevented. Because grape pips are highly polymorphic, several attempts were made to utilize their morphological diversity as a classification tool, mostly using 2D image analysis technics. Here, we present a highly accurate varietal classification tool using an innovative and accessible 3D seed scanning approach. The suggested classification methodology is machine-learning-based, applied with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique. This methodology achieved classification results of 91\% to 93\% accuracy in average when trained by fresh or charred seeds to test fresh or charred seeds, respectively. We show that when classifying 8 groups, enhanced accuracy levels can be achieved using a "tournament" approach. Future development of this new methodology can lead to an effective seed classification tool, significantly improving the fields of archaeobotany, as well as general taxonomy.},

	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
