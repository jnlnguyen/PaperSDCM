	abstract = {We performed first experiments to evaluate the potential of photoluminescence spectroscopy to detect microplastics using a 405 nm laser diode for sample excitation. A set of nine bulk plastic samples and nine samples of natural materials typically found in the marine environment were examined and compared. The plastic and non-plastic materials could be differentiated based on the shape of the acquired photoluminescence spectra. Our results show that photoluminescence spectroscopy holds the potential for reliable characterization of environmental samples regarding the microplastic content.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is controlled by many simultaneous interactions, frequently measured collectively in biology and medicine by high-throughput technologies. It is a highly challenging task to infer from these data the generating effects and cooperating genes. Here, we present an unsupervised hypothesis-generating learning concept termed signal dissection by correlation maximization ({SDCM}) that dissects large high-dimensional datasets into signatures. Each signature captures a particular signal pattern that was consistently observed for multiple genes and samples, likely caused by the same underlying interaction. A key difference to other methods is our flexible nonlinear signal superposition model, combined with a precise regression technique. Analyzing gene expression of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, our method discovers previously unidentified signatures that reveal significant differences in patient survival. These signatures are more predictive than those from various methods used for comparison and robustly validate across technological platforms. This implies highly specific extraction of clinically relevant gene interactions.},
