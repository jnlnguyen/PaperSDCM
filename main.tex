\begin{abstract}
    Microplastic contamination is an increasingly problematic risk for the
    environment and human health. To quantify its impact it is necessary to
    develop practical and cost-efficient of measuring and identifying
    microplastic samples. Here we present the classfication of microplastics
    based on photoluminesence spectra taken with an inexpensive set up, and
    pre-existing classification algorithms. For dimensional reduction we also
    use SDCM, a novel algorithm for finding corrleations in high-dimensional
    data.
